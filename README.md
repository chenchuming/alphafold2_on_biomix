# alphafold2_singularity_on_biomix
This repository hosts information about running AlphaFold2 on [BIOMIX HPC cluster](https://bioit.dbi.udel.edu/BIOMIX/BIOMIX-cluster.html) using singularity.

We have installed [AlphaFold2](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold) according to [alphafold_singularity](https://github.com/prehensilecode/alphafold_singularity).

## Run as a Slurm job on BIOMIX HPC cluster
See the example job script [`alphafold2_on_biomix_slurm.sh`](https://github.com/prehensilecode/alphafold_singularity/blob/main/example_slurm_job.sh).

N.B. this example script must be modified to suit your specific needs.
